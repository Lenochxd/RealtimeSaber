# RealtimeSaber

Tired of having to set Beatsaber to high or realtime in the task manager every time you launch the game? Here's the solution for you! Simply launch this batch file and double your FPS (it works for me at least).


## Usage
Just open it after launching Beat Saber. If it is not runned as administrator, the priority will be set in High instead of Realtime (windows fault)

## Update!!!
